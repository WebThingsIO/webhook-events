# webhook-events

Add-on for WebThings Gateway which creates webhooks that generate events and
properties for triggering rules.

After installing the add-on, you should configure it by adding the list of
hooks you plan to trigger. After doing so, you can add the "Webhook Events"
device, and then use its events as rule inputs. If you click on the chain link
icon on the device, you can find the webhook URLs.
