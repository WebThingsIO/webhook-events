# webhook-events

Add-on for WebThings Gateway which creates a webhook which generates events
that can be used to trigger rules.

After installing the add-on, you should configure it by adding the list of
event names you plan to trigger. After doing so, you can add the "Webhook
Events" device, and then use its events as rule inputs. If you click on the
chain link icon on the device, you can find the webhook URL.
